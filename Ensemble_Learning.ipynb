        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "As a data scientist predicting loan default, I would follow these steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Choosing between Bagging or Boosting:**\n",
        "   I would start with Bagging methods like Random Forest if the model suffers from high variance.\n",
        "   If the model shows high bias, I would prefer Boosting methods such as Gradient Boosting or XGBoost.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Handling Overfitting:**\n",
        "   Overfitting can be handled using ensemble averaging, limiting tree depth, using cross-validation,\n",
        "   and applying regularization techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Selecting Base Models:**\n",
        "   Decision Trees are preferred as base models because they capture non-linear relationships and\n",
        "   work well with ensemble techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Evaluating Performance using Cross-Validation:**\n",
        "   I would use k-fold cross-validation to ensure stable performance and avoid data leakage.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Why Ensemble Learning Improves Decision-Making:**\n",
        "   Ensemble models combine multiple perspectives, reduce prediction errors, and provide more\n",
        "   robust and reliable predictions, which is critical for financial risk assessment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, ensemble learning improves accuracy, stability, and trust in predictions, leading to\n",
        "better business decisions.\n"
